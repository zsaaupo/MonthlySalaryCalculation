## Salary Conditions

    * If the salary calculation month is the same as the employee's joining month, the employee's salary will not be counted.

        * For Employee Type: Intern
            - Employees will not receive any salary.
        * For Employee type: Provisional
            - Employees will receive only the basic salary.
        * For Employee type: Permanent
            - Employees will receive the basic salary.
            - Employees will receive a 5% transport allowance based on the basic salary.
            - A 10% provisional fund deduction from the basic salary will be applied.
